We provide app-based mental health support, with a focus on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).Mental healthcare is difficult for many people to access, whether because of cost, stigma or waiting times. According to a recent pre-covid study in England [1] 18% of people are experiencing a mental health issue, yet only 5% actually access help through an employer’s assistance plan (if one even exists) [2] . The majority suffer in silence. In addition to the human cost, there are significant economic costs. In the U.S., mental health issues cost employers thousands of dollars per employee per year in medical costs and lost productivity [3].At our previous company, we lost a colleague to suicide. Since then we’ve been on a mission to bring evidence-based mental healthcare to as many people as possible. We were surprised to find that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is backed by over 30 years of research, and over 250 meta-analyses [4], yet remains difficult for people to access. CBT has been shown to be effective for a wide range of mental health conditions, even when administered digitally [5] or in books (so called bibliotherapy) [6]. While we do not believe that self or app administered CBT can replace the human touch, it does provide a convenient, affordable, always accessible and stigma-free way for many users to access support, when they may not have been able or ready to seek it in person. In the UK, the NHS presents a progressive “stepped model” of mental healthcare, depending upon severity from step 1 to step 4. We see apps playing a part in step 1, step 1a and possibly step 2 of this model [7].While there are a number of CBT apps available, we wanted to base ours around Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a relatively new variant which has been used extensively in England to treat people with mild to moderate conditions at scale. In low-intensity CBT, the patient more or less treats themselves by doing exercises, and the therapist supports the process. This approach to CBT is especially suited to delivery through a digital form. Our clinical director, Professor Paul Farrand, was the architect of using Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural therapy at scale in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), and the editor of one of the first international textbooks on the subject [8].Our app presents the user with a chatbot which guides them through CBT techniques and exercises. We went for a chat-style UI to make the software more engaging—it’s a challenge to make an app of this kind be more than just a “content board”. Our chatbot engine is graph-based. At some nodes in the graph, classifiers applied to the user’s free text entry determine the path through this graph, along with the user’s state and past inputs. We want the paths within the app to be predictable and ensure that the chatbot doesn’t do anything unexpected. We’d seen more freeform generative seq2seq style chatbots produce potentially dangerous output at times in other apps and wanted to avoid this. Also, CBT has been shown to often work better when “therapist drift” is minimized—this is where the therapist drifts away from the prescribed structure of the exercises in CBT [9]. A graph-based conversation is a good way to keep things on track.We offer the app as an employee wellness benefit to organizations. Since only 5% of employees tend to use the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) at their employer, the app offers a way to support the “missing middle” for whom mindfulness&#x2F;meditation apps are not sufficient, but who aren’t ready to access their employer’s EAP. We offer use of the app completely anonymously if the user wishes. It’s in the Apple App Store at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;iona-anxiety-mood-support&#x2F;id14913... and Google Play at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.iona.menta....We’d be really interested to hear from the community about any ideas or experiences you&#x27;ve had when it comes to delivering mental health support digitally.

I’m Cody Pawlowski and my co-founder is Chase Bonhag and we’re FirstIgnite (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstignite.com&#x2F;). We help researchers at universities connect with companies interested in funding or licensing their research.Currently, a vast majority of all research goes uncommercialized. This includes everything from new cancer therapies to energy storage improvements and other solutions to universal problems. By connecting research to relevant companies, we increase the probability that research will be commercialized.We met while I was running a natural language processing startup at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Chase was working at Illinois Ventures, the venture capital arm of the university. U of I conducted over $900M a year worth of research, much of which was going uncommercialized.  Because university research portfolios are massive, diverse, and highly complex, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to figure out which companies to partner with for which research. We realized that we could apply NLP to the problem because it was written in scientific text via patents and publications!We started by taking unpaid pilots from universities in fall of 2019. Seven schools gave us two pieces of research to match to industry. For 6 of the schools, we completely failed and were unable to connect any of their research to companies. But for one school, we managed to connect both of their technologies to 5 companies each. We learned that patent databases had company interest and activity in text format that matched well to research publications.  We also learned that matching to patents was not quite enough, but if we also looked at the competitors of those holding patents we were able to identify a large enough top-of-funnel to find success on almost any topic.  We built our initial product and process around that approach.Researchers upload scientific documents describing their research and receive tailored lists of companies interested in that research. Using natural language processing and graph theory, our software analyzes the texts and matches their research to industry activity consisting of nearly 3 billion relationships stored across public and proprietary data.  We’ve had success mainly leveraging USPTO full-text and competitive intelligence data, with plans to bring in European patents, SBIR, clinical trials, job postings, corporate filings, press releases, social media, and any other text that hints at what a corporation is interested in.What’s unusual is that we’re the only solution that allows you to upload a piece of research and receive a tailored list of companies and leads to contact.  We call this active marketing—helping researchers get in touch with those who are most likely to move their research forward—as opposed to a passive marketing approach, where researchers upload their technologies in hopes of companies reaching out to them (of course, they usually don’t). Our approach results in an average of 5 meetings with companies per scientific document vs our competitors&#x27; passive approach which is lucky to result in 1 meeting.  We currently make money by selling software and service subscriptions to universities.Some examples: Professor Chou at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia uses our tool to identify companies working on cancer therapies and connect with them about potential research partnerships.  Carnegie Mellon University uses our software to market &quot;moonshot&quot; research topics to companies to identify future funding partners. UC Davis uses our tool to identify companies interested in licensing their intellectual property.We’re really excited to share FirstIgnite with this community.  We’re open to all thoughts and ideas, we’d love to learn about experiences you’ve had working on research projects, things you know about university research or corporate R&amp;D, or anything else that can help us.

I’m the founder of DocOne (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docone.io). DocOne delivers the most relevant physicians for any medical condition based on expertise. We currently cover all US physicians and ~4500 conditions.Why? The complexity of medicine is accelerating exponentially. Medical knowledge doubles every few months. To keep up, physicians are focusing on narrow groups of conditions. While there are only around 40 traditional medical specialties, in reality there are &gt;500 ultra-specialties.If there’s one thing we’ve heard over and over from physicians (when they refer their patients) and people (when they search for specialists), it’s that they struggle to identify the right physicians. I’ve personally experienced this. Old-school physician directories (hospital, insurance, 3rd party like ZocDoc and Healthgrades) are essentially phone books. They don’t rely on expertise. They use patient reviews, which have no correlation with expertise. They often sell ads.That’s why we created DocOne. Our team has a background in data science and medicine. We capture and mine large-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, and use data science (computational linguistics, NLP, shallow and deep learning language models, information retrieval) to build models of medical conditions and to rank physicians according to their relevance to any given condition. Instead of doing the traditional search by physician specialty, people can do a precise search by an individual condition.We&#x27;re excited to show you the free and open version of our platform. We&#x27;ve tested it with a narrow group of patients, but we&#x27;re ready to open it up to a broader user base. To search, start typing a medical condition and select an option from the drop down menu. Search nationwide, or type in a zip code or city&#x2F;state. Filter by specialty (the platform knows all relevant specialties for each condition, helping the user search for the right type of specialist).We hope you’ll take a moment to try docone.io and let us know how it goes.

I have to pay for it- My laptop is powerful enough to emulate my production infra- It just feels wrong to me.

I have seen that Elasticsearch is a good starting point for giant data and little queries. I have also taken a look at PostGIS which I liked a lot and seemed to be a good DBMS for the geospatial task above. What I am concerned about right now is scaling this service (which probably is not the priority right now but I want to be prepared in case this is going to work).I&#x27;ve never tried to benchmark these kind of queries but this seems to be a very read-intensive task, I imagine that 500 queries per seconds is going to be very hard to keep up with, but this are just my unproven thoughts. Also keep in mind that I will probably need to remove rows that have their timeout value expired (maybe every 10-5 minutes?) so triggers will need to be fired over the giant database.Again, I have no experience with this and this is probably a very bad implementation of the game, but I am here to ask you for advice on this.What DBMS would you recommend for this task?\nWhat kind of optimizations would you apply to this problem?','mattrighetti','story',NULL,1628957211,7,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(28181763,'Evidence of Cosmic Impact at Abu Hureyra, Syria, 12500 Years Ago',NULL,'rbanffy','story','https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w',1628957449,93,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28181861,'Use Pixar\'s story formula to win over investors',NULL,'gmays','story','https://startuppitch.substack.com/p/nail-your-startup-pitch-use-pixars',1628958150,435,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28181891,'Philippine ethnic group has most Denisovan DNA',NULL,'DocFeind','story','https://www.uu.se/en/news/article/?id=17306&typ=artikel&lang=en',1628958356,211,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28181953,'Show HN: RxEffects- reactive state and effect management with RxJS',NULL,'mnasyrov','story','https://github.com/mnasyrov/rx-effects',1628958844,5,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28182051,'Show HN: SQLite-S3-query – Python function to query a SQLite database on S3',NULL,'michalc','story','https://github.com/michalc/sqlite-s3-query',1628959522,37,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28182082,'Impact of Pocket Listings on Housing',NULL,'caseyf7','story','https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/houses-are-getting-scooped-up-before-theyre-listed-its-shutting-people-out-of-homeownership',1628959770,15,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28182113,'Ask HN: What we as community can do to adopt IPv6 faster?','All I can think of is tweeting, emailing big corps or maybe creating a petition, so that these companies take this seriously.

SigmaOS is a new type of browser, designed to make you better and faster working on the web.If you’re anything like us, you work hours a day on the web, buried in a sea of tabs and web apps, constantly losing context and always one click away from being distracted. We believe that a radically different UX can help with this and that’s what we’re making. Here’s a demo video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ae_XfTSsaAA.This project is the overlap of our obsessions. I have always been obsessed with organizing because of my ADHD, and became a power user of software that could organize and clean up my workflow, like Superhuman and Notion. I was frustrated by how cluttered my desktop was with irrelevant Safari windows and tabs that I didn&#x27;t need for my work right then. Also, I always felt overwhelmed by the constant switching of windows and apps to save information I was finding or send stuff to people I was working with. This led to the idea: what if there could be a much more organized browser, and you could easily access any app or tab or note directly from within the browser without needing to change to a different window?Ali has always been into neo-browsers. Rockmelt (released when he was 11) was the first piece of software he deeply cared about and referred his friends to. Since Rockmelt&#x27;s shutdown, multiple different neo-browsers came out, but none were as mind-blowing to him. He is also a power user of Photoshop and loves their single-key keyboard shortcuts. Saurav rarely cares about software but is a massive Vim fan. He is obsessed with how fast and powerful Vim makes him at text-editing.  So, if you think Rockmelt crossed with Notion crossed with Vim, that’s basically what we’re working on :)SigmaOS users create workspaces that hold apps and pages related to a project or task. We present those apps and pages in a list format. Users have 3 main actions to go through tasks quickly: they can mark a page as done, snooze a page when they don&#x27;t need it right away, and move a page once it is no longer required for that task but maybe for some other one.We help solve the problem of information loss and overload with our search tool called Lazy Search. You can quickly find pages in your history and already-open pages across workspaces. This makes it easier to find anything you have opened or searched before and navigate to it quickly.We have a split-screen feature to quickly open a second webpage, for example for a quick new search you want to do or multitask by working on two pages at a time. This cuts down on opening unnecessary tabs and navigating away from what you are focused on.One of the most straightforward but also most powerful aspects of SigmaOS that we’ve put a ton of thought into, is an intuitive and easy-to-learn repertoire of keyboard shortcuts for all the most-used commands and actions. This makes you a lot faster at your work on the web and feels like the other tools (cf. Vim above) that you’re traditionally productive in.SigmaOS connects your web apps and your browsing activity to understand the context around your actions and searches. Your information is organized by projects, your work is shareable and collaborative, and information retrieval feels effortless. We charge $15 per month, no ads, and no data monetization.Thanks for taking the time to read our post. We appreciate any and all feedback on what you think is the best thing about SigmaOS and what might not be so great. Please download SigmaOS from our website and give it a try yourself and let us know what you think here :)','MahyadGhassemi','story',NULL,1629119031,151,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28197591,'Ask HN: How can I use the scientific method to write better code?','Highly enjoyed this previous post on empirical evidence available for dev practices (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28178257)This made me start thinking about my own practices, and what processes I could adopt to improve.

Awesomic is a website where you create a design task and receive a draft from a professional designer in 24 hours.On freelance platforms, it takes up to 7-14 days to find the right designer. You negotiate, then manage, and you need to look for a new person every time a new task is needed, like branding first and then a website design for web and mobile. With Awesomic, our algorithm connects you based on availability and expertise required. Then, you never manage this person or worry about deadlines—we do it automatically and guarantee a 24h turnaround. You have all skills covered under one fixed price subscription.While running a local online business (coding school, the first Github partner in the CIS region), we had the hard time hiring the right designer part-time. We experienced a lack of quality, style consistency and speed as freelancers changed. Roman, my co-founder, thought that being matched with the right person on subscription would be the perfect solution. We got traction in 10 days just from the idea, with no product. Our first client was YC alumni Outtalent, and the next 20 clients came from word of mouth. Our best-selling ad was a napkin left in a co-working space—it brought us People.ai as a client.For the first 2 months, we emulated the app processes manually and turned the tasks around in 24 hours via email. Since then we’ve been gradually building software for everything that can be automated, including matching tasks, managing daily updates, files and communication. \nOur matching algorithm defines the criteria of each task (like timezone, type of task, software) and finds the best-fit designer due to them. When you create a logo task, you work with the best logo&#x2F;branding designer. When you do an app or landing page that requires different skills, an algorithm will match you with a great UI&#x2F;UX designer. If you like the result, you will continue to work with the same person based on matching.When you log into our app (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.awesomic.io&#x2F;login), you can choose any popular design task brief or add a custom one. Then you describe the task, and it gets matched with the best-fit designer. In 24 hours you see the first results, and every business day a new update is guaranteed for you. So you can iterate fast on any visuals and stick to your deadlines. The expertises covered are branding, graphics, product UI&#x2F;UX design and animations. You communicate with the designers directly in the app, via comments or screenshare calls. All files are stored on private DigitalOcean Spaces and are accessible over the platform, so you don’t need to go back and forth between various tools, email, etc. We operate on a subscription model, but it is flexible: startups can upgrade&#x2F;downgrade or cancel their plans anytime. This helps to stay cost-effective and scale easily.Here’s a case study on how we made a redesign for the most funded app on Kickstarter: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;awesomic.io&#x2F;case-study&#x2F;memory-os. Here’s one on a Norwegian fitness startup using us for 18+ months already—their app is in the top 10 most popular apps in the country: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.awesomic.io&#x2F;case-study&#x2F;entirebody.As specialists, we’ve been reading HN for quite some time and we are really excited to share our story with you.

I work in quant finance in London, UK (in ML&#x2F;statistics). I graduated with a PhD in CS and sort of fell into this field when a recruiter contacted me with the promise of $$$ that is hard to get in any other field unless you&#x27;re at Google. I&#x27;m on a pretty decent salary even by London standards, but I&#x27;m utterly miserable.1. The job is meaningless. When I first started in the field I thought I enjoyed it, but now I see that the bonuses were what excited me about the job, not the actual work.2. Although the money is good, an &#x27;adequate&#x27; house in London would cost at least 10 times my salary. I&#x27;m renting a flat with my partner. It&#x27;s a reasonably decent flat by London standards, but because we&#x27;re renting we can never really make it a home.3. London is a horrible place to live. I have no affinity for it whatsoever. Even if I could afford a house I would not want to live here.4. My home town is an hour flight away but if I were to move home I would most likely take at least a 2&#x2F;3 pay cut. I would prefer to live back home. But doing that would ruin any chances I ever had of being able to retire early.5. My parents, like most boomers, had a much better standard of living when they were my age. My father had a pretty average salary, bought a massive house for a reasonable price, and saw his wealth multiply many times over. It&#x27;s not like that for my generation.My partner is in a similar job to me and he is making multiples of what I&#x27;m making (although it&#x27;s more stressful than mine). Luckily for him, he hates his job less than I do, so he could probably stick it out a few years longer.I have just come back from 2 weeks holidays at home with my parents and was pretty much in tears this morning starting another day at work. It&#x27;s so hard to muster up any motivation for the job, especially now that the company is in a dry period pnl-wise. I much prefer my home town to London, but I can&#x27;t expect my partner to move back with me, as he is doing extremely well in his career and it would be career suicide for him.I have racked my brain trying to figure out what field I would prefer to work in, but I can&#x27;t think of anything. I just go round in circles thinking about it. Given that anything else would involve a massive pay cut, I think I would regret leaving the job I&#x27;m in. I could probably grind leetcode for a couple of months to try to get into Google, but I would find working at Google utterly meaningless as well. I have the ability to work hard to pass an interview, but I&#x27;ve been working for long enough now that I find it difficult to muster up any enthusiasm during job interviews, which is probably a red flag for potential employers. I&#x27;m no longer young and excited about this stuff!I&#x27;m interested in computers and programming in general, but doing it for a living ruins the joy. I would love to be able to retire and get into meditation &#x2F; travelling the world &#x2F; learning about things for fun.','thebrowncat','story',NULL,1629135696,176,1,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(28200752,'DuckDuckGo’s simple plan to make the internet more private',NULL,'thunderbong','story','https://www.protocol.com/duckduckgo-ceo-interview',1629135851,12,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28200849,'Ask HN: What is your work chair/desk?','I&#x27;ve learned that investing in a good work chair is worth it after all, but is no surprise.

For the last 7 years, I have written all my web apps in a full-stack programming language called Imba. It compiles to JavaScript and its main goal is to make web developers more productive.I just launched a major overhaul of Imba, so I wanted to share it here on HN, in case anyone are interested in learning more about it. It is very opinionated, so some of you might not like it, but I would love to hear anyones feedback regardless. Constructive criticism appreciated!The backstory:Imba initially started in 2012 as an effort to bring the elegance and conciseness of Ruby into the browser, and also because I felt that JavaScript and the DOM should be more tightly coupled together. Over the years, I have taken inspiration from React&#x2F;JSX, and also Tailwind.Since 2013, I have built several business-critical apps in Imba, so this is not a toy project or an academic exercise, it is extracted from a real project trying to solve real problems. Today, we are currently a small but passionate community of devs who use Imba all over the world.The nitty-gritty details:As mentioned, Imba compiles to JavaScript, and it works on both the frontend and backend. The quickest way to get a feeling of how it works is by checking out this video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8XS5q9xhaMcAlternatively, here is a list of the main benefits of the language:* Clean syntax with built-in tags and inline styles* Imba&#x27;s Memoized DOM approach is *an order of magnitude* faster than Virtual DOMs (Vue, React). Learn more here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-virtual-dom-is-slow-me...* Imba works with Node and the npm ecosystem, and integrates tightly with both JS and TypeScript* Blazing-fast dev&#x2F;build tools based on esbuildEach of the benefits above are explained more thoroughly in our docs here, so please check it out if any of the above points spark your interest: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imba.ioWith this version I feel that I am very close to my vision for what Imba should be. In other words; it is finally ready for public consumption. I&#x27;d wholeheartedly advice you to look into it and give it a whirl if you are interested in web development :)Hope you like it, and please share any feedback you might have in the comments!PS!

It’s affecting several people with the same name as me, whose lives are being impacted.In January 2021, I published a non-fiction book about a difficult, traumatic topic: my victimization and sex crimes that I witnessed toward other women. Because I am a victim, I chose not to put a photo of myself online. In fact, I have never ever taken a selfie nor had a photo of myself online.Four months after I published my book, Google created a knowledge panel for me and, because I didn’t have a photo online, they just grabbed a photo of another Andrea Vassell who lives in Canada and displayed it alongside my book and claimed this woman was the author. After spending weeks sending feedback and trying to get help from Google support, they finally deleted the woman’s photo, but then promptly replaced it with another Andrea Vassell who is a pastor in New York. She, the pastor in New York, wrote to me that she has been “attacked” because people believe she is me.I contacted Google again and asked them to please delete the knowledge panel because I did not have a photo on the Internet; therefore, any photo that they displayed alongside my book would be of the wrong person. By this time, some of the characters in my book were also being negatively affected because now it seemed they had harmed a pastor of a church.I kept contacting Google and finally at the end of May, the knowledge panel was deleted, only to return a week later with a photo of a man who had been fired for his threats toward me. That photo remained until July 2021, and was then replaced with the pastor in New York again, although this time it’s a different photo of her.I know that I am not a celebrity or an important person, but I spent two years writing a very difficult and personal book and to have a large corporation come along and continuously and consistently misrepresent my work and cause distress to others is becoming exceedingly stressful for everyone involved.I contacted the Federal Trade Commission and they told me to contact the BBB and IC3.gov. I received an automated response from BBB and I don’t understand the reasoning behind contacting IC3.gov. I am currently working on a second book which I assume will be added to this knowledge panel with the photo of the wrong woman.I would greatly appreciate any input about how to get this corrected so that I and others can move on. I know this is probably just an algorithmic glitch, but it’s affecting not only me but several others, and at this point I have no idea how to get Google to take it seriously.','AndreaVass','story',NULL,1629249759,450,1,NULL,1,NULL,1),(28216736,'An Apple Affray',NULL,'vtriolet','story','https://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/930-An-Apple-Affray.html',1629249773,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216741,'Program Synthesis with Large Language Models',NULL,'tasdfqwer0897','story','https://twitter.com/gstsdn/status/1427794393373626368',1629249846,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216772,'CA drought: Past dry periods have lasted more than 200 years, scientists say',NULL,'hncurious','story','https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/01/25/california-drought-past-dry-periods-have-lasted-more-than-200-years-scientists-say/',1629250081,49,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216820,'Muzzle sent to vaccine expert was bought on Amazon, credit card in her name',NULL,'latchkey','story','https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/muzzle-sent-tenn-vaccine-expert-bought-amazon-account-credit-card-n1277017',1629250527,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216831,'Fierce Pharma',NULL,'graderjs','story','https://www.fiercepharma.com/',1629250622,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216840,'Show HN: Infinity Maps – first knowledge worker tool build on a gaming framework',NULL,'ribx','story','https://app.infinitymaps.io/maps/HFD2jf2Rgb4/LmnTQ2bpTGq',1629250720,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216848,'Visas 54 Bitcoin-Linked Cards Pave Way for Younger Generation to Spend Crypto',NULL,'DocFeind','story','https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2021/08/17/visas-54-bitcoin-linked-cards-pave-the-way-for-younger-generations-to-spend-growing-crypto-wealth/',1629250824,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216861,'Facebook,TikTok won’t lift ban on posts promote Taliban after fall Afghanistan',NULL,'throw7','story','https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/taliban-content-banned-on-facebook-instagram-whatsapp.html',1629250894,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216864,'The Commonwealth Bank’s Afterpay competitor StepPay launches today',NULL,'Khaine','story','https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/the-commonwealth-bank-s-afterpay-competitor-steppay-launches-today/ar-AANqT9V',1629250958,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(28216865,'Biden Wanted to Leave Afghanistan.

The matter is that we are also an open-source security vendor and we are building a standard tool for every company to store customer records and with the highest level of security and privacy compliance: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;databunker.org&#x2F;.So, according to Armon, the motivation for #Hashicorp was the following:In a Pre #Oracle world, every company was building its own database.Every company that manages any data had to build their own storage engine, their own query engine, their own everything.This was a huge tax on the entire industry.But once you have a set of vendors that provide standard SQL solutions, like Microsoft, Oracle, Sybase, etc... then you can build higher-level applications that consume the database.For us (#Hashicorp), it felt like, where we are with our tools.When we started, everyone was building their own platform, everyone was rolling its own approach to automation.Shouldn&#x27;t there be a set of vendors who sell that for you and you just operate it rather than building it?Original podcast: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;founderformula.sounder.fm&#x2F;episode&#x2F;33About Databunker \nInstead of each company building its own data privacy and GDPR
